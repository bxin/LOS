This code calculates the Line of Sight (LOS) change using 
[dx dy dz Rx Ry Rz] for M1, M2, M3, Cam in the Terrestrial Coordinate System.

LineofSight_Test.m 		demonstrate how to use the code. 
LineofSight.m			main code that takes the output of make_4x4_TCRS.m and 
				calculates the LOS
make_4x4_TCRS.m			creates the 4x4 operation matrices for each optic, using 
				its [dx dy dz Rx Ry Rz]
make_LOS_senM.m			creates the optical sensitivity matrix that conforms with 
				the format of the master (16x16) operation matrix

data/RB_sensitivities.mat	rigid body optical sensitivity matrix (extracted from Zemax)
