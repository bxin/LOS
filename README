This code demostrates how to calculate the Line of Sight (LOS) change using 
[dx dy dz Rx Ry Rz] for M1, M2, M3, Cam in the Terrestrial Coordinate System.
A user also has the option to output the Line of Sight Matrix (LOSM) for later use.

The code is in Matlab. Creating and outputing the sensitivity matrix requires the Matlab Symbolic Math Toolbox. Once the LOSM is created, no special Matlab toolbox is required.

Once the LOSM is created, the LOS change can be calculated as
    	 LOS = LOSM * Vcg
LOSM is the Line of Sight Matrix, which can be created using instructions below.
Vcg is the center-of-gravity displacement vector of the M1M3, M2, and the Camera.
LOSM is a 2x18 matrix. Vcg is a 18-element vector, whose elements are
[M1M3dx, M1M3dy, M1M3dz, M1M3Rx, M1M3Ry, M1M3Rz,
M2dx, M2dy, M2dz, M2Rx, M2Ry, M2Rz,
Camdx, Camdy, Camdz, CamRx, CamRy, CamRz]
The units should be microns for translations, and arcseconds for rotations.
LOS is a 2-element vector. The unit is arcsecond.

To create LOSM for 15/45/86.5 degree elevation angles, run
   	  LineofSight_Test1(45,1,1,1,0,'simulink/LOSM_matrix45.mat')
	  LineofSight_Test1(15,1,1,1,0,'simulink/LOSM_matrix15.mat')
	  LineofSight_Test1(86.5,1,1,1,0,'simulink/LOSM_matrix86.5.mat')
The last argument can be any file name a user wants to use. The file needs to be in Matlab format.

For users' convenience, the LOSM matrices for 15/45/86.5 degrees are generated and included in the repo.
simulink/LOSM_matrix45.mat		LOS matrix for 45 deg elevation angle
simulink/LOSM_matrix15.mat		LOS matrix for 15 deg elevation angle
simulink/LOSM_matrix86.5.mat		LOS matrix for 86.5 deg elevation angle

LineofSight.m			main code that takes the output of make_4x4_TCRS.m and 
				calculates the LOS
make_4x4_TCRS.m			creates the 4x4 operation matrices for each optic, using 
				its [dx dy dz Rx Ry Rz]
make_LOS_senM.m			creates the optical sensitivity matrix that conforms with 
				the format of the master (16x16) operation matrix
shift_CG2Vtx.m			this routines converts the 18-element center-of-gravity
				    displacement vector into the displacement vector of
				    the optical vertices.
LOS_matrix.m			this routine calls LineofSight.m, and rearrange
				the calculations into a matrix multiplication.
